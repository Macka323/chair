### Settings (general settings)

Manual time for sitting ( this changes how much you can sit on the chair in minutes ) you can chose from 0-90 minutes and the rest time is automatically configured for your own health
the ratio for rest time is 6:1 that means if you chose to sit 30 min you have to test minimum of 5 min and so on and so on.

There is also a button for default time for sitting which is set 30 min for sitting and 5 min for rest, and the extended time for sitting which means that you can sit for 60 min or 1 hour and you have to rest for 10 min.

You have buttons for stopping or restarting the system and buttons for powering off or restarting the electronics.
